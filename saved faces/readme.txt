# We must try to save the images as "image_{image number}_{time when image taken}"

    Ex - image_72_19732455635   (The random looking number are the miliseconds when the iamge is taken.)

'Image_Number' can be done using the 'eval' function, if we use it in a list, or rather simply the 'Iterartive Value' of the Loops.

'Image_Time' can be easily achieved by using the "time" function of Python.
